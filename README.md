# Wells-Fargo-Analytics-Challenge
This project was how we started off the "Introductory" Data Science course.

The excel document is the data set we were given and the instructions for the competition were as followed:

 *"Senior leaders at Wells Fargo are looking for a new product, service, or application (the "Solution") that will improve the overall customer experience ("Business Objective").  Based on your analysis of the data, what recommendations do you have for senior leaders at Wells Fargo?"*
 
 Vague enough?
 
 It was an incredibly fun, incredibly difficult project. It took a lot of work researching how to use R, effective methods to help bring ideas around, just alot of grinding to manipulate data in order to do work on it. I spent more than a couple nights closing down the library working on an idea I wanted to implement, and I am excited by the idea of being able to condense usefull information out of a large set of data.
 
 Week 5 took a lot of work, not to mention the fact that a server crash resulted in me losing approximately 4 hours of work. 
 
 Its all in good fun!
